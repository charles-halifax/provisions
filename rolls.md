| 1/2 cup                                  | 4              | 113      | Cinnamon sugar (6 1/2 tablespoons granulated sugar mixed with 1 1/2 tablespoons ground cinnamon) |      |

In a small bowl, sprinke the yeast in the lukewarm milk. Stir the misture iwth a spoon or a whisk to dissove the yeast. Set aside for about 5 minutes before mixing it into the dough. 



Place the butter, oil, and sugar in the bowh of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and cream together on medium speed until smooth (or use a large metal spoon and mixing both and do it by hand). In a small bowl, lightly whisk together the vanilla and egg yolks to break up the yolks. Add the egg yolk-vanilla mixture to the butter-sugar mixture in four installents, beating on mediuam speed (or vigourously by hand) after each addition until incorporated, and before adding the next addition. When all the egg yolks are incorporated, or the mixture is fluffy, stopping to scrape down sides of the bowl with a spatula or bowl scraper once or twice, if needed (or beat vigoursly by hand). Turn off the ixer and add the flour, salt, and yeast mixture. On low speed, mix for 2 to 3 minutes, or until a soft slightly sticky dough forms (you may have to switch to the dough hook if your mixer struggles with the paddle attachment; if mixing by hand, use a strong spoon or your hands).



Sprinkle flour on the counter (or use an oil slick method). Use a plastic bowl scraper to transfer the dough to the work surface. Knead the dough by hand for an additonal 2 minutes, adding more flour, only if needed, to make the dough pliable but still tacky. The dough should be a beautiful holden colour and feel soft and supple, "like a baby's bottom". Form the dough into a ball and place it into a lightly oiled bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator overnight (or for up to a maximum of 3 days). The dough will rise somewhat but will not double in size (if it rises signifigantly in less time, you can degas it and return it to the refridgerator). During this interval, prepare your cinnamon sugar and chosen glaze and set it aside or refridgerate. 



On the day of the bake, remove the dough from the refridgerator about 1 hour before you plan to bake but begin rolling out and shaping the dough immediately, while the dough is still cold and firm. Melt the butter for brushing. Mist the counter with spray oil, or create a light oil slick, and transfer the chilled dough to it. Using a rolling pin, gently roll out the dough into a 16-18 inch square 1/4 to 1/3 inch thick. Brush the melted butter over the the surface and then sprinkle the cinnamon sugar evenly over the surface, leaving a 1/4" border uncovered around the full perimeter. Roll up the dough like a jelly roll (or like a carpet), forming a log, and place it, seam side down, on the counter. Using your palms and firm but gentle pressure, roll the log to extend it's length a few more inches, preferably to between 20 and 24 inches. Cut the log crosswise into 8 to 12 spiral buns, each about 2 inches thick. 



If making cinnamon buns, line 2 sheet pands with baking parchment or silicone baking mats and place the buns, face up (spiral side up), on the sheet pans, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Preheat the oven to 325 with the oven racks in the middle shelves. proof the buns at room temperature while the oven heats up; the cold dough will not rise now, but it will rise dramatically after you place the pans in the oven. Bake the buns for 10 minutes. Rotate the pans and continue baking for 5 to 15 minutes longer, or until the buns are a rich golden brown. When the buns are ready, remove the pan(s) from the oven and let cool in the pan for 5 to 10 minutes. If using the fondant galze, drizzle it over the warm buns. if using the cream cheese glaze, spread it on the buns with an offset spatula or iceing spreader. You can serve these immediately after glazing or let them cool on the pan or on cooling racks from the glaze to firm up or set. 



If making sticky buns, mist 3 round 9 inch cake pans with spray oil and then voat the bottoms with a 1/4 inch thick layer of the caramel or honey almond glaze or a 1/3 inch thick layer of the old fashioned caramel glaze. (You may not need all the glaze; the leftover will keep in a covered container in the refrigerator for about 2 weeks). Sprinkle the nuts or dried fruit over the glaze (wht addition is optional but highly advised for flavour). Place the 4 buns, nicest spiral side face down, in each pan, spacing them about 1 inch apart. The buns will rise and spread while baking, filling the pans. Preheat the oven to 325F with a rack in the lower third of the oven (so the glaze gets plenty of botto heat). Set up a second rack on the lowest level. Bake the buns as soon as the oven is ready, rotating the pans every 10 minutes for even baking. They should take 25 to 35 minutes. The glaze will melt, bubble, and caramelise, and the visible dough will be a dark golden brown. If the glaze begins to bubble over the rim of any pan, place a sheet pan on the lowest oven rack to catch the drips, But do not put the second pan in the oven unless the glaze bubbles over, as the direct bottom heat is important during the first part of the bake. To see how the buns are doing, lift a bun with a metal spatula or a pair of tongs; the underside should be a light caramel brown, not white. The glaze itself should turn a rich amber or golden brown, and all the sugar should have melted to become caramel. If the glaze is still grainy and not richly caramelized, place a sheet of aluminium foil over the top of the buns and keep baking until the glaze becomes smooth and caramelised. 

When the buns are ready, remove the pans from the oven and let the buns cool for 3 to 5 minutes to allow the caramel to begin to firm up. Invert a plate over the top of a pan, flip the pan and plat together, place on the counter, and lift off the pan. be careful, as the glaze will still be very hot. Use a rubber spatula to carefully scoop any run-off glaze or any glaze remaining in the pan over the buns. Repeat with the remaining pans. Wait for at least 15 minutes before serving.
