# Ingredients
- 2 cups (240g) flour
- ½ tsp (3g) salt
- 1 cup (227g) unsalted butter
- ½ cup (100g) sugar
- 2 egg yoks
- 2 tsp (5mL) flavoring liquid (e.g. vanilla extract)
- ⅓ cup sanding sugar

# Instructions
1. In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the butter, salt, and sugar together until light and fluffy.
2. Add the egg yolks while mixing. Scrape down sides of the bowl.
3. Add vanilla extract.
4. Pour in the flour mixture and mix until incorporated.
5. Roll the dough into a log. Wrap in parchment paper or plastic, then chill it in the refrigerator for at least an hour. I've found the best way to keep the dough from flattening out on the bottom is to pop it into an empty cardboard paper towel roll.
6. Preheat oven to 350F (180 C)
6. Once the dough is chilled sprinkle sanding sugar on a clean surface. Unwrap the dough and roll in the sugar.
7. Use a sharp knife to cut dough into slices of even thickness.
8. Place cookies on a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake for 10-12 minutes or until the edge is **JUST** turning golden brown.

# Notes
- Measure your flour precisely! Adding too much flour to the recipe is the most common mistake. The best, and easiest way to measure flour is by using a scale. If you don't have one then fluff your flour with a spoon, sprinkle it into your measuring cup, and use a knife to level it off.
- Sanding sugar gives a nice crunch to the edge but it's totally optional. You can skip or use regular granulated sugar as a replacement.
- For a crisper cookie leave the baking sheet in the oven, turned off and the door cracked slightly open after baking. This will help dehydrate the cookies further to that butter cookie out of the tin crunch.
- This recipe can be used for cut out cookies. Just form the dough into a disk, wrap and chill then roll out to 1/4 inch, cut and bake.
- Use a good vanilla for this recipe. It's one of the stand out flavors here so you don't want to use the artificial stuff.
