# Yorkies (Yorkshire Pudding)

Similar to a popover or a dutch baby, a bready side that's good with roasts or can be stuffed.

## Tips

* The fat that you cook them in is key. Lard is good, Duck Fat is better.
* The pan and fat needs to be HOT when you pour the batter. It's basically the most important thing.
* The colder the batter is when you add it to the oil, the better.
* I use a muffin tin.
* You can rest the batter overnight for the best results.
* You can use a blender to make the batter.

## TODO Tweaks

* Try to get a bigger "drop" in the middle by opening the oven 5-10 minutes before they're done
* Does sifting the flour make a difference? How about a blender versus whisking?
* Vary fat load - is more better?
* Try to add a dollop of jam after being added to pan and make breakfast yorkies.
* Make a giant one in a cast-iron.
* Vary flour / egg ratio, add bakers percentages

## Ingredients

* 4 eggs
* 200ml milk
* 140 grams cups all-purpose flour
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* Lard or Duck Fat or oil

## Preparation

### Batter

> The batter can be prepared the night before

1. Whisk the eggs and milk until combined
2. Add the flour and mix again. This should end up as a runny batter. 
3. Let rest for at least 30 minutes in the fridge, up to overnight.

### Cooking

> Speed is key when you add the batter, the oil should be as hot as possible.

1. Preheat oven to 425
2. Add approx 1/2 tablespoon of fat to each cup
3. pre-heat the tray so that the fat is really hot. You may not hit the smokepoint of lard or duck fat
4. Give the batter a good stir before pouring
5. Fill each tin to 3/4 full
6. Bake 15-20 minutes until golden brown
