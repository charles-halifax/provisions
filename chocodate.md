# Chocolate Date Cookies.
These are perfect crunchy-on-the-outside, chewy-on-the-inside cookies w/o nuts!
Makes 1.5 doz 5inch cookies

## Ingredients
- 3.5 cups + 2 tbsp unbleached all purpose flour (even better if you store flour in the freezer)
- 1.25 tsp baking soda
- 1.5 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt for dry mix, and a few pinches for topping
- 1/2 tsp holiday spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves -- pumpkin pie spice works too)
- 1.25 cups softened butter (salted)
- 1.25 cups brown sugar (dark pref)
- 1 cup + 2 tbsp sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 4 tsp vanilla extract
- 1.5 bags of ghirardelli 60% cacao chocolate chips
- 1 cup finely chopped dates. Yes, chop whole dates. Don't get the pre-chopped date poops from the grocery store. Wetting the knife occasionally will help.

## Preparation
1. Sift dry ingredients together into a bowl
2. Cream butter and sugar in a stand mixer until very light, about 5 minutes.  Add eggs and vanilla and spices, mix well.
3. Add dates, mix well, and let sit for a minute
4. Add dry ingredients to wet slowly, mix just until combined, 5-10 seconds. Mix in chocolate chips.
5. If the flour was cold, the dough should be fairly cool at this point and you can go on to the next step, otherwise smooth dough and cover tightly with plastic wrap, refrigerate 30 mins. 
6. Preheat oven to 375, scoop big golfball size mounds of dough (ice cream scoop works well here) onto parchment lined baking sheet, sprinkle lightly with sea salt and bake just until golden brown highlights appear, 15-16 minutes.
7. Let cookies cool on baking sheet 10mins and transfer to wire rack
8. Use two baking sheets, one in the oven and one cooling/being loaded with dough.  Don't put dough on a hot baking sheet.
