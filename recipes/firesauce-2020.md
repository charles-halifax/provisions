These are all the variations of the [firesauce](recipes/firesauce.md) attempted in 2020, along with their notes.

All of these variants went through _roughly_ the same process, for varying amounts of time (due to laziness/schedules).
There's two big differences through:
  1. Most of the recipes have a **single pepper type** in them
  2. Any that needed a kick got some amount of the Reaper Madness added, for kick

**NOTE**: Percentages taken from the amount of vegetables used. The weight of the sugar is ignored.

We made [Reaper Madness](reaper-madness.md) with some of these peppers. Since it's not fermented it doesn't appear here.

## Variations
| Name | Vegetables | Sugar | Salt | Water |
| ---- | ------- | ------: | -----: | ----: |
| Peach 09.19 | 1,079g Peach pepper + 21g garlic | 21g (1.9%) | 21g (1.9%) | 1C |
| Citrus 09.19 | 1,375g Lemon/Orange spice Jalapeno + 41g garlic | 27g (1.9%) | 34g (2.4%) | Â¼C |
| Red 09.19 | 3,835g Fresno + 575g garlic | 110g (2%) | 132g (3%) | None! |
| Green 09.19 | 1,871g JalapeÃ±o + 187g garlic | 41g (2%) | 41g (2%) | Â¼C |
| Yellow 09.20 | 384g yellow bell pepper + 393g aji pineapple + 116g garlic | 17g (2%) | 17g (2%) | None! |

## Results
### Red 09.19 :relaxed:
- Fermentation time: 14 days
- Finishing steps: Â½C distilled white vinegar, brought to boil, simmered for 10-15 minutes
- Yield: 72 oz
- **NOTES**: Pretty solid base and lots of it! May add some to some fresher Fresno, garlic salsa to make something closer to California Sauce
