# Firesauce 2019
These are all the variations of the [firesauce](recipes/firesauce.md) attempted in 2019, along with their notes.

All of these variants went through _roughly_ the above process, for varying amounts of time (due to laziness/schedules). **NOTE** that basically all of these came out to ~ 4 cups (2 pints/1 quart) of mash to ferment. Plan jars appropriately.

# Variation Results
## Smoked Anaheim :frowning:
- Fermentation time: Unrecorded
- Finishing steps: as in the recipe above
- Yield: 2 cups
- **NOTES**: Came out **super** bitter for some reason and **super** smoky. Nothing in finishing could save it so it got left in the fridge unfinished in hopes it would mellow. The current theory is that the amount of solids that ended up in the sauce is what doomed it.

## Green 9.2 :relaxed:
- Fermentation time: ~ 10 days
- Finishing steps: Added Â½C vinegar, very mild reduction, Â½tsp [Xanthan Gum](https://www.bobsredmill.com/xanthan-gum.html) via WholeFoods
- Yield: 2 cups
- **NOTES**: Came out **great** but started separating after finishing. Didn't cook it down much because it had pretty good texture after straining. Added solids to thicken it but that started making it bitter so took the solids back out. Learned about Xanthan Gum from [this article](https://www.pepperscale.com/sauce-too-thin-how-to-thicken-hot-sauce/) -- may have used too much.

## Orange 9.2 :relaxed:
- Fermentation time: ~ 9 days
- Finish steps: Added â…›C apple cider vinegar, very mild reduction on the stove, Â½tsp xanthan gum
- Yield: 2 cups
- **NOTES**: Came out **great**, shorter heat-reaction than the greena bove

## White 9.10 :frowning:
- Lost due to mold during fermentation + not smelling like anything after the mold was removed

## Red 9.9 :relaxed:
- Fermentation time: 12 days
- Finishing steps: Added â…›C apple cider vinegar, Â½tsp xanthan gum
- Yield: ~ 1.75 cups

## Orange 9.15 :neutral_face:
- Fermentation time: 7 days
- Finishing steps: Added â…›C apple cider vinegar, Â¼ + â…›tsp xanthan gum

## Orange Dragon 9.15 :confused:
- Fermentation time: 7 days
- Finishing steps: Added â…›C seasoned rice wine vinegar plus a bit more, Â¼tsp xanthan gum

- Fermentation time: ~ 9 days?
- Finishing steps: Added â…›C seasoned rice wine vinegar, Â¼tsp xanthan gum

## Dragon 9.23 :confused:
- Fermentation time: ~ 9 days?
- Finishing steps: Added Â¼C white vinegar, â…›tsp xanthan gum
