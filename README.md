# Ingredients
- 230 g Fresno chillies (“red Jalapeño”) with stems trimmed but green tops left on
- 150 g bell peppers (red/yellow) with stems trimmed flush to top of pepper
- 35 g (one small head, ~ 10 cloves) garlic
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/2 cup distilled white vinegar (you’ll need it much later)

This made ~ 5 ounces when pushed through a fine mesh strainer.

# Preparation
1. Medium/rough cut chilies and peppers into 1/4" or 1/2" pieces
2. Peel garlic cloves and cut in half
3. Add everything to blender and blend until “smoothie” consistency
4. Transfer to a glass jar
5. Cover with tea towel/paper towel and secure with a rubber band or similar
6. Put somewhere you don’t mind smelling like hot sauce (a garage is ideal)

# Fermentation
1. Check back in 3 days for tiny fermentation bubbles
2. Stir roughly daily
3. Repeat for at least two more days (five days of fermentation), or until you stop getting new bubbles **or** you get bored

# Finishing
1. Pour fermented stuff back into blender (be sure to get it all!)
2. Add ½ cup distilled white vinegar
3. Blend until completely smooth (1-3 minutes)
4. Pour into a mesh strainer over a medium sauce pan
5. Push mixture through strainer with a rubber spatula
6. When you think you've got it all:
  1. Grab anything flat and rigid (table knife, whatever)
  2. Run it along the bottom of the strainer, then push more through the strainer
  2. Repeat this until you run out of patience (at least twice more)
7. Bring sauce to a boil and then simmer for 5-10 minutes or until it has the consistency you want. NOTE: this sauce will thicken up even more once it cools
8. Let sauce cool for a while, maybe put the pot in the fridge if you have room
9. Bottle as appropriate and stick in the refrigerator, you’re done!
