# Reaper Madness
This isn't fermented so it doesn't count as [firesauce](firesauce.md). This is the recipe from [Chili Pepper Madness](https://www.chilipeppermadness.com/recipes/carolina-reaper-hot-sauce/), scaled down to what I had on hand.

***This recipe is dangerous*** at two points:
1. Burnt peppers will essentially tear gas your house. **DO NOT LET THAT HAPPEN.** Open all the windows and turn on all the fans you can to be safe.
2. The fumes in the blender / food processor are tear gas / pepper spray. **BE VERY CAREFUL**. Even with an N95 mask you won't want to point the open container at your face.

Once everything is bottled it's much safer.

## Ingredients
- 4 oz / 114g Carolina Reapers, stems removed
- 20 g garlic cloves
- ~ 76 g white onion
- 1½ tablespoons distilled white vinegar
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ½ C water

## Equipment
### Protective Gear
- N95 mask
- Goggles (_ideally_ splash goggles)
- Long sleeve shirt
- Latex/nitrile gloves

### Processing Gear
- Food processor / small blender
  - **NOTE** - A single batch of this recipe isn't much volume. A large blender / food processor might have trouble getting everything.
- Bottle(s) + appropriate funnel
- Chopstick or similar for feeding through funnel if you want it thick
- Silicone spatula or similar for scraping down side of food processor

## Directions
1. Collect protective gear, pre-heat oven to 400 F, take processing / bottling equipment ***outside***
2. Bake reapers, onion, and garlic on a baking sheet for ~ 10 minutes. **DO NOT LET THEM BURN**.
3. **Don protective gear** and ***take ingredients outside***
4. Blend everything until smooth
5. Add more water/vinegar if you want it thinner, little by little
6. Bottle!
7. ***Label appropriately***! You wouldn't want anybody thinking this was mild!
